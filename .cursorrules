# Cursor Rules for Chess Trainer MCP Project

## Development Guidelines

### Application Startup
- DO NOT automatically start the application (client/server)
- The user has already started both client and server manually
- Avoid running `npm start`, `npm run dev`, or similar startup commands
- Focus on code changes and file modifications only

### Code Style
- Use modern JavaScript/TypeScript features
- Follow Svelte best practices
- Maintain responsive design principles
- Keep accessibility in mind

### Testing
- Test changes manually after implementation
- Verify responsive behavior across devices
- Ensure WebSocket connections work properly

### File Organization
- Keep components organized in appropriate directories
- Maintain clean separation between client and server code
- Update documentation when making significant changes
